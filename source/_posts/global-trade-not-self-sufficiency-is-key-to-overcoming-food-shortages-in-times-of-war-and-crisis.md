    <p>
        The war in Ukraine has aggravated existing tensions on global food markets
        that can likely be traced back to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since late 2021,
        prices for agricultural commodities such as grains and vegetable oils have
        reached record highs, surpassing even the levels of the global food price
        crises of more than a decade ago. Now, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has
        sent prices soaring even higher. This risks destabilizing food security
        in import-dependent countries with low per capita incomes, especially in
        the MENA region and sub-Saharan Africa, that source their wheat from Russia
        and Ukraine. Disruptions to exports from the Black Sea Region and high
        prices are further compounding the already critical food situation in these
        regions.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, global demand for wheat is expected to be met in the current
        marketing year and countries such as India, the USA and Australia will
        increase exports to fill the supply gap left by Russia and Ukraine. It
        is difficult to predict what will happen beyond this marketing year, as
        this will be determined by the development of the current conflict in addition
        to agricultural fundamentals in key supply and demand regions. However,
        preliminary forecasts do not predict dramatic changes in the global trade
        volumes of key agricultural commodities in the coming marketing year. Nevertheless,
        international agricultural trade flows may have to adapt, which could have
        negative consequences. Prices are not expected to fall any time soon and
        consumers, particularly in developing countries, will be expected to carry
        the burden. European agriculture and consumers are not predicted to experience
        any major changes in the medium term.
    </p>
    <p>
        Open and competitive global trade is needed to overcome (potential) trade
        disruptions and create supply structures that can easily adapt to shocks,
        no matter the cause. Calls to move towards a centrally planned economy,
        isolation or self-sufficiency are strongly advised against, as this would
        only be to the detriment of food security in the Global South.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Even if exports from other countries can offset trade disruptions in
        the Black Sea Region, geopolitical efforts must be made to ensure that
        Ukraine and Russia remain key parts of the world agricultural trading system.
        This is the only way to achieve global food security. Their high production
        and export potential bolsters the ‘safety net of international agricultural
        trade’ and contributes significantly to combating hunger in the Global
        South,” says IAMO Director Thomas Glauben.
