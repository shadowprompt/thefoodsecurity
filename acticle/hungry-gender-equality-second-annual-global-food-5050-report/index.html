    <p>
        Around the world, women play a key role in every part of the food system,
        but their contributions are often undervalued, underpaid, and overlooked.
        Women and girls also face a disproportionate burden from shocks, such as
        those driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the current food and cost-of-living
        crisis. Women and girls are more likely to face food insecurity and malnutrition—in
        2021, at least 126 million more women than men experienced food insecurity,
        a gap that continues to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Global food system organizations are critical to advancing gender equality
        and building women’s empowerment. But how do their own workplace practices
        measure up? The Global Food 50/50 initiative, a collaboration between Global
        Health 50/50, IFPRI, and UN Women, assesses how well these organizations
        perform on gender equality, with the goal of building more effective organizations—and
        ultimately more equitable and sustainable food systems. Hungry for Gender
        Equality, the initiative’s second annual report, reviews the gender and
        equity policies and practices of 51 major organizations, complementing
        the leadership analysis with a focus on the board members of governing
        bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The launch event, held October 18 as part of the World Food Prize 2022
        Borlaug Dialogue virtual side-events, presented major findings from the
        report and explored potential for future progress. In his opening remarks,
        Johan Swinnen, CGIAR’s Managing Director for Systems Transformation and
        IFPRI’s Director General, emphasized the risks facing women: “On the brink
        of COP27, as the global community comes together to design, implement,
        and monitor crisis responses, these solutions must provide resources to
        help women and girls cope with crisis in the short term and challenge the
        systems that perpetuate inequality.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Sarah Hendriks, Director of the Policy, Programme, and Intergovernmental
        Division at UN Women, underscored how food systems embed multiple and intersecting
        forms of discrimination against women and girls. “Now is the time for collective,
        decisive action and accountability,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
        In his keynote address, Ambassador Gabriel Ferrero, Chair of the Committee
        on World Food Security (CFS), discussed the importance of the Global Food
        50/50 report to the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s
        and Girls’ Empowerment in the Context of Food Security and Nutrition, which
        are currently being negotiated by member states.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Global Food 50/50 is not just a report—it is both an accountability and
        a change mechanism,” said Jemimah Njuki, Chief of Economic Empowerment
        at UN Women. Sonja Tanaka, Deputy Director of Global Health 50/50, presented
        in-depth findings from this year’s report. Although public commitment to
        gender equality remains high, nearly half of organizations in the report’s
        sample lack transparent plans for diversity and inclusion, and half have
        more men than women in leadership bodies. Most board seats are occupied
        by nationals from high-income countries, and 70% of CEOs and board chairs
        are men. Of the 351 board seats assessed in the report, only 2% are held
        by women from low-income countries.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the panel discussion moderated by Hazel Malapit, Senior Research Coordinator
        at IFPRI, representatives from civil society organizations, development
        partners, and policymakers highlighted the critical importance of gender
        equality, both to food systems as a whole and to organizations and their
        programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the informal sector, women working in the food supply chain face
        unique risks related to climate change and markets. Megha Desai, Senior
        Coordinator for the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in India,
        noted that the sector’s contribution to food systems is “invisible but
        vital,” and called for action and research targeting women’s needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Martha Nyagaya, the Country Director for Kenya at Nutrition International
        (NI), emphasized the interconnections between food security, nutrition,
        and gender. “At NI, we try to achieve an equitable, inclusive organization
        that confronts and addresses gender equity by promoting diversity in our
        governance structures in leadership and decision-making, but, most importantly,
        in our programs,” she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
        From the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Benjamin Davis, Director
        of FAO’s Inclusive Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division, discussed
        recent progress in achieving workplace gender equality, as well as future
        goals. He commended the GF5050 initiative, saying “the report is a much-needed
        resource for the global response to gender inequality at the highest institutional
        level. The fight is not over, and it needs to happen at all levels, from
        the boardroom to communities to within families.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Maura Barry, the Senior Deputy Assistant to the Administrator for USAID’s
        Bureau for Resilience and Food Security, highlighted recent White House
        and USAID initiatives to advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility.
        “We know that gender equality and women’s empowerment can help eradicate
        poverty, build vibrant economies, and unlock potential on a transformational
        scale,” she said, further noting that “if women are not involved in developing
        and implementing solutions, our work will not be as impactful and sustainable
        as it could be”.
    </p>
    <p>
        In closing remarks, Sarah Hawkes, Co-Founder and Co-Director of Global
        Health 50/50, reflected on the many crises facing the world’s women. She
        emphasized that “words on paper” mean nothing without implementation, saying
        “Accountability mechanisms like this report make sure that those great
        words on paper are actually measured and monitored.”
